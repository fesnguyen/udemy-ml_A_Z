UCB (Upper Confidence Bound) algorithm:

Exploration: Trying new actions to learn more about the environment and potential rewards.
Exploitation: Choosing actions that have historically yielded high rewards.
Upper Confidence Bound: A value that represents the maximum expected reward for an action, considering both the observed rewards and the uncertainty associated with that action.
