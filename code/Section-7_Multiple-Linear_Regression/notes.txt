6 consideration needed before choosing linear regression model:
- Linearity: It has a linear relationship between dependent variable y and independent variables X
- Independence: No autocorrelation (Value of a data point is related to its preious values or subsequent data points)
- Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors should be constant across all levels of the independent variables.
- Multivariate Normality: The errors should be normally distributed.
- Bonus: Check for the outlier

P-Value: Consider toss a coin 6 time and all 6 are tailed (With probability < p-value 5%) then we sure 95% that the coin is not fair

5 methods to select feature for models:
1. All-in
2. Backward Elimination
3. Forward Selection
4. Bidirectional Elimination
5. Score Comparison
These all called stepwise Regression
